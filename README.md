# Argus

> **Argus** is a student opportunity platform. It pulls internships, scholarships, competitions, hackathons and events from **live sources** into one place, ranks them for your profile with an AI-powered insight layer, and **reminds you before every deadline.**

Most students juggle a dozen siloed platforms and still miss things — and the costliest failure mode isn't a weak profile, it's a **deadline that slipped by**. Argus is a neutral *aggregation + reminder layer* across every category: it surfaces what's relevant to you and pings you in time. We always deep-link out to the original site to apply — we're never the application endpoint.

## What it does

| Pillar | How |
| --- | --- |
| **Cross-category feed** | Internships · scholarships · competitions · hackathons · events, normalised into one `Opportunity` schema. No incumbent does this — each is siloed to one vertical. |
| **Live aggregation** | 15 source adapters fetched server-side, cached, deduped. Verified live: **213+ opportunities** across all categories on first scan. |
| **Eligibility-aware filtering** | Branch, year, CGPA, state, category, gender → opportunities you *can't* apply to are hidden. Missing fields default to *eligible* so noisy data never wrongly hides a match. |
| **Transparent ranking** | A deterministic weighted score (no ML training, no pay-to-rank) with a free **"why this matched you"** explanation on every card. |
| **AI insight layer** | Dual-LLM backend (Groq → Gemini fallback) powers AI summaries, match explanations, smart tags, deadline intelligence, resume analysis, side-by-side comparisons, weekly digests and natural-language search. |
| **Deadline nudges** | Reminders at **T-14d / T-7d / T-3d / T-1d / T-3h** via in-app center, **real browser push (web-push/VAPID)**, **email (via Resend)** and one-tap **Add-to-Calendar (.ics + Google)**. |
| **Persistent profiles & auth** | Firebase Auth (Google sign-in) with Firestore-backed profiles, saved collections, and notification preferences that sync across devices. |
| **Distinctive design** | A clean, light "signal" system — an authored cyan-teal palette, Bricolage Grotesque display type, category tiles, deadline-warmed countdowns, per-card match glyphs, a command palette (⌘K) and a floating tab bar. WCAG-minded, mobile-first. |

## Quick start

To run Argus locally, you will need a `.env.local` file with your API keys.

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
# ── Firebase (required) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your_firebase_api_key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your_firebase_auth_domain"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your_firebase_project_id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your_firebase_storage_bucket"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your_messaging_sender_id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your_app_id"

# ── AI providers (at least one recommended) ──────────────────────────────────
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"              # Primary — free at console.groq.com
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"           # Fallback — free at aistudio.google.com/apikey

# ── Email notifications ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RESEND_API_KEY="your_resend_api_key"           # Free at resend.com

# ── Push notifications (optional, auto-generated if absent) ──────────────────
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY="your_vapid_public_key"
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY="your_vapid_private_key"

# ── reCAPTCHA (optional) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY="your_recaptcha_site_key"

# ── Optional API-gated sources ───────────────────────────────────────────────
ADZUNA_APP_ID="your_adzuna_app_id"             # Free at developer.adzuna.com
ADZUNA_APP_KEY="your_adzuna_app_key"
KAGGLE_USERNAME="your_kaggle_username"         # From kaggle.com → Account → API Token
KAGGLE_KEY="your_kaggle_key"
```

2. Install dependencies and start the server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

On first load, the feed performs a live scan across all sources (with skeleton loaders); subsequent loads are extremely fast due to local `.cache/` data. VAPID keys are auto-generated on first push-subscribe if env vars aren't set.

---

## Live data sources

All fetched **server-side** (no per-request scraping in the browser), cached for 30 min, deduped, with per-source health surfaced in the UI. We prefer official APIs/JSON, scrape only public pages politely, and always link back.

| # | Source | Tier | Category | Access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Devpost** | green | Hackathons | Public JSON `devpost.com/api/hackathons` |
| 2 | **Devfolio** | green | Hackathons | Public JSON `api.devfolio.co` (India-heavy) |
| 3 | **Unstop** | amber | All categories | Public JSON (browser UA) — best single India source |
| 4 | **ETHGlobal** | green | Hackathons | HTML scraper via `cheerio` on `ethglobal.com/events` |
| 5 | **MLH** | amber | Hackathons | Embedded JSON extracted from `mlh.com/seasons/2026/events` |
| 6 | **Codeforces** | green | Competitions | Official API `codeforces.com/api` |
| 7 | **CodeChef** | green | Competitions | Public JSON contests API |
| 8 | **Kaggle** ¹ | green | Competitions | Official API `kaggle.com/api/v1` (HTTP Basic auth) |
| 9 | **Greenhouse ATS** | green | Internships | Official board JSON for ~20 India-hiring companies |
| 10 | **Arbeitnow** | green | Internships | Public job-board API (remote/early-career breadth) |
| 11 | **Adzuna** ¹ | green | Internships | `api.adzuna.com` India jobs endpoint |
| 12 | **Luma** | amber | Events | Public JSON `api.luma.com` — meetups, workshops, talks across 5 Indian cities |
| 13 | **Scholarships** | seed | Scholarships | Curated dataset of ~29 real Indian awards (govt + private + study-abroad) |
| 14 | **Seed** | seed | Mixed | ~20 curated India-relevant fallbacks so the feed is never empty offline |

> ¹ **Env-gated** — these sources only join the registry when their API keys are set in `.env.local`. Add the keys, restart, done.

> **Avoided on purpose:** LinkedIn / Indeed / Internshala scraping (ToS / legal risk) and DoraHacks (strict anti-bot WAFs/hidden search APIs). We deep-link out instead. See `src/lib/sources/*` — each adapter implements the same `SourceAdapter` contract and one failure never sinks the run (`Promise.allSettled`).

## How ranking works (`src/lib/rank.ts`)

A transparent two-stage recommender that runs as a pure function in milliseconds:

1. **Hard eligibility filter** — drop closed deadlines and anything the student is provably ineligible for. *Only* high-confidence fields filter; missing = eligible.
2. **Weighted soft score** (semantic embeddings off by default):

   ```
   skill 0.40 · interest 0.25 · urgency 0.15 · recency 0.10 · popularity 0.05 · location 0.05
   ```

   - **skill** — overlap of your skills with the opportunity's tags over a shared ~150-term controlled vocabulary (with a synonym map: `ml → machine-learning`, `js → javascript`, …). Branch affinity seeds matches for cold-start profiles.
   - **urgency** — peaks ~8 days out (the sweet spot to act), penalises <2 days and far-off items.
   - **recency** — `exp(-ageDays/14)`. **popularity** — `log1p` of applicants. **location** — remote / same-city / relocate.
   - **Cold-start**: signals a new profile can't produce are dropped and the weights renormalise.
   - **Explainability is free** — the top contributing signals are templated into chips like *"Matches 2 of your skills: Machine Learning, Python · Closes in 5 days"*. Open any card → **"How this was scored"** shows the full weighted breakdown.

Default feed sort is **Closing soonest** (the deadline value prop); also Best match and Newest.

## AI features (`src/lib/ai/`)

A dual-LLM backend with automatic failover keeps AI features virtually immune to rate limits:

| Chain | Model | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary** | Groq `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | Fastest inference; 100k TPD free tier |
| **Fallback 1** | Groq `llama-3.1-8b-instant` | Auto-switches on 429; 500k TPD free tier |
| **Fallback 2** | Google `gemini-2.5-flash` | Independent quota; used only when all Groq attempts exhaust |

All AI responses are **file-cached for 7 days** (`.cache/ai/`) with content-hash invalidation — if an opportunity changes, the cache busts automatically.

### Feature catalogue

| Feature | Endpoint | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AI Summary** | `/api/ai/summary` | Structured breakdown: what, who should apply, eligibility, skills, benefits, difficulty |
| **Why This Matches You** | `/api/ai/match` | Personalised 2-3 sentence match explanation referencing your actual skills |
| **Smart Tags** | `/api/ai/tags` | Auto-classifies from a 24-tag vocabulary (Beginner Friendly, Remote, Paid, etc.) |
| **Natural-language Search** | `/api/ai/search` | Query expansion: "remote AI internships" → 12-15 search terms with synonyms |
| **Deadline Intelligence** | `/api/ai/deadline-insight` | Action-oriented insight: preparation time, early-close risk, what to do now |
| **Resume Analysis** | `/api/ai/resume` | Upload PDF → skill extraction, gap analysis, match score against an opportunity |
| **Side-by-side Compare** | `/api/ai/compare` | Multi-opportunity comparison table with a best-pick recommendation |
| **Weekly Digest** | `/api/ai/digest` | Personalised weekly roundup with urgent-deadline callouts |

---

## Deadline nudges (`src/lib/nudges.ts`, `/api/test-nudge`)

- Deadline-**relative** schedule (not a fixed weekly blast): **T-14d** (high-effort scholarships/competitions/hackathons), **T-7d, T-3d, T-1d, T-3h**.
- **Relevance-gated** — only high-relevance matches (score > 0.5 or top-N) with a real deadline.
- **Multi-channel**: in-app center + **real Web Push** (VAPID) + **Email Notifications** (via Resend) + one-tap **.ics / Google Calendar**.
- **Anti-fatigue**: per-channel toggles, quiet hours (default 8am–9pm IST), frequency cap, snooze, weekly digest.
